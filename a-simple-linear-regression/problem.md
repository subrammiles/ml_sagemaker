## Problem Statement

The goal of this problem is to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet) using Simple Linear Regression.

Given a dataset containing house sizes and their corresponding prices, we aim to:

1. Build a linear regression model that captures the relationship between house size and house price.
2. Determine the **slope (m)** and **intercept (b)** of the best-fit regression line.
3. Use the trained model to **predict the price of a new house** given its size.
4. Visualize the actual data points along with the regression line to understand the model fit.

The model assumes a linear relationship of the form:

          Price = m*(House Size)+b
where:

 m =represents how much the price changes per unit increase in house size, and
 b = represents the estimated price when the house size is zero.

This approach helps demonstrate how linear regression can be applied to real-world problems such as **real estate price estimation**.
